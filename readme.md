    1. create and empty folder `mdir <name>`
    2. cd into that folder `cd <name>`
    3. initialized the repo `git init`

-Committing your work
    1. add files to staging `git add .`
    2. commit `git commit - m "message"`

-Push work to github
    1.create a new repo github.com
    2. copy the url https/ssh for the repo
    3. add the remote repo to your local repo `git remote add orgin <url>`
    4. push up the commits `git push origin main` or `git push origin master`

-misc commands
